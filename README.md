**English is not my native language, so you may not understand my words**

An interesting plugin by Pepper~

When you press SHIFT and R key:

1. If there is a block on the minecart, the block will be kept in your hand. (except TNT, chests, etc.)
2. If there is no block on the minecart, the block which you kept will be placed in the minecart

Interact with custom minecart is supported! (like Crafting Table Minecart) ：

Specially:

1. You can't sit on custom minecarts!
2. There might be some bugs in the plugin.
